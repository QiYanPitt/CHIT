# Allele-specific method for testing the association between gene expression and phenotype-genotype interaction

## Introduction
The combined haplotype interaction test (CHIT) tests the association between gene expressions and phenotype-genotype interactions by modeling the total read counts and allele-specific reads in a target gene region. Each test is performed based on a test SNP-feature region pair that is defined by users. Thus, this method can test both cis- and trans-regulatory effect.
